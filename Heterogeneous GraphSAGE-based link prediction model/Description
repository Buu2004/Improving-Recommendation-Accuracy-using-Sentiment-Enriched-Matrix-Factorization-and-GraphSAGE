This study introduces a straightforward neural network architecture that utilizes heterogeneous GraphSAGE to predict connections between users and items.

GraphSAGE is a powerful deep learning framework designed for inductive representation learning on large graphs. Unlike traditional graph 
learning methods that rely on full graph structure, GraphSAGE generates embeddings by sampling and aggregating features from a node's local neighborhood. 
This makes it highly scalable and capable of handling dynamic, evolving graphs, as it does not require re-training when new nodes or edges are added. 
In recommendation systems, GraphSAGE offers significant advantages by efficiently capturing complex relationships and patterns within user-item interactions. 
Its inductive nature ensures adaptability to new data, maintaining performance even as the user base and item catalog expand.

Heterogeneous GraphSAGE extends the approach to heterogeneous graphs, which consist of multiple types of nodes. This extension is particularly advantageous
for building recommendation systems with two node types: users and items. By incorporating user and item nodes, heterogeneous GraphSAGE captures the complex
interactions between users and items more effectively than homogeneous models. This leads to richer and more meaningful representations. In addition, 
aggregating features from different types of nodes allows the model to learn from the diverse characteristics and behaviors associated with each type.

The proposed network comprises two SAGE convolutional layers for embedding generation from initial node features. 
Each convolutional layer uses the mean aggregator, as described in Eq.(2) of the original paper.

For link prediction, the method calculates the cosine similarity between user and item embeddings, applying a sigmoid activation to predict the likelihood 
of a link. Binary cross-entropy loss between predicted and actual edge labels is used to optimize the model parameters.
