Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) is a machine learning approach tailored for collaborative filtering in recommendation systems, especially effective for handling implicit feedback. BPR emphasizes the relative ranking of items according to user preferences. This pairwise ranking strategy is particularly adept at capturing users' implicit interactions, resulting in highly personalized recommendations. In recommendation systems, BPR is beneficial because it directly focuses on optimizing ranking quality instead of rating prediction accuracy. This makes it more effective in scenarios where the objective is to provide users with a ranked list of items, such as in online retail or media streaming services. The BPR method involves sampling pairs of items for each user: one item the user has interacted with (positive) and one they have not (negative). The model parameters are then adjusted to increase the predicted preference score for the positive item over the negative one. This process is repeated multiple times to refine the embeddings of users and items, optimizing the model for better ranking accuracy. In this study, embeddings generated by BPR will be used as input to the proposed model to improve link prediction performance. To thoroughly explore the optimal dimension, embeddings of varying sizes—10, 50, and 100—will be created and analyzed.
