# Improving-Recommendation-Accuracy-using-Sentiment-Enriched-Matrix-Factorization-and-GraphSAGE

In the age of information overload, effective recommendation systems are crucial for helping users find relevant content. This study explores the integration of traditional matrix factorization (MF) methods with GraphSAGE for enhanced link prediction in recommendation systems. By applying sentiment analysis to review data for generating initial embeddings, the approach addresses the limitations of rating-based methods. Experiments on the Amazon movie dataset reveal that this hybrid model significantly improves prediction accuracy, evidenced by higher AUC values. The findings demonstrate that combining MF and graph-based techniques leverages their respective strengths, offering a robust and reliable framework for predicting user preferences.
